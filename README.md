# Catts (Calmer Alt-Tab Task Switcher)

__Catts is a calmer <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> task switcher for [elementary OS 6 (Odin)](https://elementary.io).__

For elementary OS versions 5.x, please use [Gala Alt Tab Plus](https://github.com/markstory/gala-alt-tab-plus).

![Screenshot of Catts in action. The switcher contains four icons: Web, Email, Tasks, and Calculator. Tasks is selected. The switcher is in dark mode. The wall paper behind the switcher is an illustration in blues and purples of a woman standing with her arms stretched out to her sides as if to embrace the cityscape and vast open sky and clouds before her. At her feet, her cat mimics her pose.](./catts-screenshot.jpg)

## Install

> __Catts is in Beta.__ If you experience any problems installing or using it, please [open an issue](https://github.com/small-tech/catts/issues) and let me know.
>
> _The following instructions download and install the Catts shared library binary. If you want to build it yourself instead, please see the [for developers](#for-developers) section._

__Open up a Terminal session (press <kbd>‚åò</kbd> + T) and copy and paste the following commands to install Catts on your system.__

Please use the copy/clipboard button that appears when you hover over a code snippet to ensure that you copy the whole command instead of just a portion of it by mistake.

1.  __Download Catts__ shared library binary ([libgala-catts.so](https://small-tech.org/downloads/catts/1.0.0/libgala-catts.so)) from [small-tech.org](https://small-tech.org) to the temporary directory on your computer (_/tmp_):

    ```shell
    wget https://small-tech.org/downloads/catts/1.0.0/libgala-catts.so -O /tmp/libgala-catts.so
    ```

2. __Verify the downloaded file__ is what you expect:

    ```shell
    bash -lic "test \"\$(sha256sum /tmp/libgala-catts.so)\" = 'c73ce1c713fbf8b7e261c20d70268580fa6f7d1bd5a70a4e1ba5ea50d20206fc  /tmp/libgala-catts.so' && echo 'Download OK.' || echo 'üõë STOP. Security error. File has been tampered with. DO NOT PROCEED.'"
    ```

    __Unless you see `Download OK`, do NOT proceed to Step 3.__ (Instead, [open an issue here](https://github.com/small-tech/catts/issues) and let us know what happened.)

3. __Install the downloaded file__ as a [Gala](https://github.com/elementary/gala) plugin:

    (Terminal will warn you that you are trying to paste a command that requires administrative privileges. When you press return to execute it, the command will prompt you to allow it administrative privileges by entering your system password.)

    ```shell
    sudo mv /tmp/libgala-catts.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gala/plugins/; sudo chown root:root /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gala/plugins/libgala-catts.so
    ```

4. __Reboot.__

    If you don‚Äôt want to restart your computer, you can also start using Catts right away by issuing the following command:

    ```shell
    gala --replace &
    ```

    But it‚Äôs cleaner if you reboot. And less to type too:

    ```shell
    reboot
    ```

You can now <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> in peace.


### If Alt + Shift + Tab doesn't work‚Ä¶

Elementary ships with <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> bound to switch keyboard layout. Go to _Settings_ ‚Üí _Keyboard_ ‚Üí _Layout_ and either set _Switch layout_ to _Disabled_ (if you don‚Äôt have multiple keyboard layouts) or to a different key combination. Elementary should really ship with this setting set to _Disabled_ by default.

## Why Catts?

Because:

  - <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> is a hidden, shortcut gesture for quickly switching between the various windows you have open.

  - There is already a graphically-heavy, slower alternative with the ‚ÄúShow Desktop‚Äù (<kbd>‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>‚Üì</kbd>) gesture that gives you an overview of the windows within a workspace with window previews that can be used if differentiating windows based on their contents is important.

__In elementary OS, however, the task switcher:__

  - __Overloads the dock__ (the dock is transformed to include icons of windows and the icons there used to indicate which window you‚Äôre switching to). This breaks the physicality of the dock and overloads its meaning. That said, due to the amount of other animation going on, willing myself to concentrate on the dock is the only way I can use it at all.

  - __Has excessive motion__ (animates windows backwards or forwards while dimming them in/out every time you press <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd>). Imagine that happening with maximized or half-screen windows on a 24" monitor. I don‚Äôt normally have issues with motion and it makes me feel seasick after a few uses.

  - __Gets stuck.__ Sometimes it will just get stuck in a state where no window is selected. Pressing <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> again gets you out of it.

  - __Is one-way__ (<kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd>) doesn‚Äôt do anything.

Basically, the task switcher in elementary OS is unusable.

This one, despite its [limitations](#limitations), at least fixes the above issues.

__Catts:__

  - __Is calm.__ It does not animate my windows. I don‚Äôt want cognitive complexity when I‚Äôm fast switching between apps. I want to select the app I want to switch to and switch to it. That‚Äôs it.

  - __Uses icons.__ There is very little cognitive load to recognising an icon. There‚Äôs a reason we use icons of applications in menus, etc., instead of tiny thumbnails of them. The same principles apply here.

  - __Enables you to tell apart different windows of the same app__ (simply, by displaying the window title in the switcher alongside the icon).

  - __Uses the system colour scheme.__ Love Dark Mode? Catts does too.

I feel elementary OS would be far more usable in general ‚Äì not to mention more familiar for folks just coming over from macOS or Windows ‚Äì if Catts (or something like it) were to [replace the official task switcher in elementary OS](https://github.com/elementary/gala/discussions/72#discussioncomment-219601).

## Limitations

Catts implements the bare minimum functionality for a calm task switching experience and nothing more.

It currently has the following major limitations:

  - [__Drag and drop does not work.__](https://github.com/small-tech/catts/issues/2) You should be able to both (a) continue a drag and drop that you started prior to activating the task switcher (e.g., you want to drag a photo from Photos into the app you‚Äôre working in) and (b) you should be able to drag and drop onto the icons which should act as proxies for the apps/windows themselves.

  - [__Only includes apps in the current workspace.__](https://github.com/small-tech/catts/issues/3) You should be able to switch to apps in any workspace.

  - [__Cannot exit app with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> while selected.__](https://github.com/small-tech/catts/issues/5) It is a productivity boost to be able to use the task switcher to close and app by quickly selecting its icon and, while continuing to hold down <kbd>Alt</kbd>, pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> to quit the selected app (especially when you want to quit several apps together). This is currently not supported by Catts. The workaround is to switch to the app first and then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd>.

If you‚Äôd like to help us implement any of these features, [please say hello on Discussions](https://github.com/small-tech/catts/discussions) and tell us which of these limitations you‚Äôd like to help overcome.

## For developers

The following are technical details for developers who want to manually compile or hack on Catts.

### Dependencies

* elementary-sdk
* libclutter-1.0-dev
* libwnck-3-dev

Make sure you `apt install` all of the above requirements before trying to build.

## Build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

## Test

Modifying the primary gala instance can result in a broken desktop that requires a restart to fix.

After following the Installation instructions, stop before the ‚ÄòRestart Gala‚Äô step and, instead, use [xephyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xephyr) to create a separate session:

```bash
sudo apt install xserver-xephyr

# Running the test script starts up a new session using
# xephyr and launches the Calculator, and Tasks apps.
./test.sh
```

When the xephyr window appears, give it focus by pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> and test out the new alt-tab behaviour.

__Note:__ Don‚Äôt have the Calculator or Tasks apps running in your primary session before running the test script as that will lead to the app not launching in your test session.

Once you're done testing you can remove the plugin with.

```bash
./cleanup.sh
```

## Replace Gala

After you‚Äôve built Catts, you can replace the task switcher in your main session by running:

```shell
# Restart Gala
sudo gala --replace &
```
